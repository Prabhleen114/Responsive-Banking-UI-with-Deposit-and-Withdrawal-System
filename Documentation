# Conceptual Understanding (Interview Preparation)

### 1. Explain the CSS Box Model components
The CSS Box Model consists of:
- Content
- Padding
- Border
- Margin

These layers determine spacing and layout behavior of elements.

### 2. How do media queries enable responsiveness?
Media queries apply different CSS rules based on screen size, resolution, or device characteristics, allowing layouts to adapt to various devices.

Example:
```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        flex-direction: column;
    }
}
